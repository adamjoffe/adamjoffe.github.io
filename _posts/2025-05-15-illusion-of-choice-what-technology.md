__NOTES__

Illusion of choice: What technology to use?
0. Intro - What technology is the wrong question, what product and for what customer is the right question
1. Inverted Problem - People are selfish, it's not their fault, they only know what they can see, which is always their PoV. Engineers want to pick what interests them (why, what, how)
2. The why: customer - Product dies without customers, so we start here
3. The what: product - How does the product solve the customer issues? How does it give value
4. The how: technology - How to optimise the what, clear direction, measurable target, feedback loop
5. The irony of creativity - unlimited freedom doesn't produce creativity, constraint does. Starving artist, social commentary, all key art and literature came from constraint
