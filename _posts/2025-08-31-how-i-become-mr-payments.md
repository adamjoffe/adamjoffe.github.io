*NOTES*

How I became "Mr. Payments"

* Quote from anonymous engineer
* always ask questions
* don't stop with a working solution
* put yourself in the customers shoes
* always consider "what knowledge do I have that others don't" when explaining things. This avoids confusing or misleading assumptions.
* go from first principals, build up understand like LEGOs
