## Origins

"Mr. Payments" was a nickname given to me about a year into my time working at a [B2B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business-to-business) bank. I had joined the payments team which was responsible for the entire end-to-end payments pipeline and experience:

* Clearing:
* Ledger:
* Transaction Monitoring:
* User experience:
* Security:

Previous to this I had worked in other FinTech spaces (e.g. market surveillance, loan origination) but never in the payment space. The only previous applicable skill was my time writing algorithms to spot suspicious or illegal activities on exchange markets, which tangentially related to transaction monitoring. Within the space of the year, I was able to become a subject matter expert in this area and able to lead projects, manage key stakeholders, and drive product direction.

In this post, I want to discuss my approach to learning within a new space, and how to build up your knowledge at light-speed to become an invaluable asset.

*NOTES*

How I became "Mr. Payments"

* Quote from anonymous engineer
* always ask questions
* don't stop with a working solution
* put yourself in the customers shoes
* always consider "what knowledge do I have that others don't" when explaining things. This avoids confusing or misleading assumptions.
* go from first principals, build up understand like LEGOs
