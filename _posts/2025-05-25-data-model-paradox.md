*Notes:*
Data model paradox
0\. Intro - Data model is the hardest to change, so you want to make sure it's right. To get it right you need to know more about the domain or use case. The know more about the domain or use case you need to try things out. The try things out you need to iterate and improve a solution. To start building a solution you need a data model...

1. Will I needs this? - don't add things because you think you'll need it in the future. Adding easy, removing harder
2. When to migrate - how to know when things need to change a bit
3. Hindsight 20:20 - when to rebuild the model entirely and transform (duplication "shadow mode")
