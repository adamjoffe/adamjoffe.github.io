*NOTES*:

0. Intro - Main reason I see for people picking a dynamically typed language (i.e. Python) for a project is to move quickly. Typing can slow you down, and you want to focus on business logic and customer value
1. Type Help - as system grows, resilience and deterministic behaviour become critical. Typing helps you with both of these. Many dynamic languages have static type checkers, but they are limited
2. Aged Like Fine Milk - "should have just used a strongly typed language from the start". Transformation is hard. This happens quicker than you'd think. (Cost vs cost/unit manufacturing graph analogy) - data governance issues with loose types, nothing to rely on and no assumptions to simplify
