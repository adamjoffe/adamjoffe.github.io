## Origins

"Mr. Payments" was a nickname given to me about a year into my time working at a [B2B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business-to-business) bank. I had joined the payments team which was responsible for the entire end-to-end payments pipeline and experience:

<!-- TODO: outline what these are -->

* Clearing:
* Ledger:
* Transaction Monitoring:
* User experience:
* Security:

Previous to this I had worked in other FinTech spaces (e.g. market surveillance, loan origination) but never in a payments space. The only somewhat applicable skill I had was from my time working in market surveillance. During this time I was in the team responsible for writing algorithms to spot suspicious or illegal activities on exchange markets, which only tangentially relates to transaction monitoring. From this almost zero knowledge start, within the space of the year, I was able to become a subject matter expert in this area and able to lead projects, manage key stakeholders, and drive product direction.

In this post, I want to discuss my approach to learning within a new space, and how to build up your knowledge at light-speed to become an invaluable asset.

## Starting

When approaching a new space where you don't have any prior domain knowledge, there will be an almost overwhelming amount of information to take in. The way I approach this is to immediately start grouping information into categories which I use to compartmentalise the knowledge. This breaks things down from an excessively large, amorphous problem space into discrete components which can more easily be comprehended. When doing this, it is never going to be perfect, since correctly dividing up the space requires complete knowledge (similar to what we see in the [data model paradox](../data-model-paradox)). This means as you build up the knowledge, these categories will change, shift, and intersect with each other, this is entirely expected and will reflect the intertwined nature of a domain space. Allowing this to happen will also help you later when you can draw on these overlaps to build valuable associations when applying your problem solving skill set.

Once we have some rough categories, the next step is gather as much knowledge as possible. When reading documentation, discussing in meetings, or even reading pull requests, always ask further questions. Even if you think you can correctly assume the answer from your existing knowledge, these clarifying questions convert assumptions to tangible facts. One key not here is to try avoid derailing conversations where a large group of people are involved (think 8+ engineers). You want to be able to scale your own knowledge, but this shouldn't be at the cost of a lot of engineering time, and doesn't have to be either! The better approach in these scenarios is to take notes of your questions during the conversation and then asking them to a more senior member after. This provides the same outcome to you, but without any downside to the wider team. Worse case, you will derail the engineer you talk to, which at most may drag 1 or 2 further people in. Even then, from my experience, when this occurs you usually get a net benefit due to the need of the senior member bringing in others means that there was a lack of clarity that will now be fixed.

## Building

* go from first principals, build up understand like LEGOs
* don't stop with a working solution

## Retro

* always consider "what knowledge do I have that others don't" when explaining things. This avoids confusing or misleading assumptions.

* teach/help others -> reflective learning

* put yourself in the customers shoes
