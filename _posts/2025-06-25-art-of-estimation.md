*Notes:*

0. Finger in the air maths, cone of uncertainty
1. Rough equivalence (sin-theta = 1 for low angles)
2. Common incorrect choice due to bad estimation, performance vs. readability
3. Not just how to estimate but when to estimate. When weighing up a problem, recency bias or personal feelings easily cloud judgement of how important something it to work on. Stepping back and doing estimates helps create quantitative data points to help decide.
