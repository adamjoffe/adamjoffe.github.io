## Origins

"Mr. Payments" was a nickname given to me about a year into my time working at a [B2B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business-to-business) bank. I had joined the payments team which was responsible for the entire end-to-end payments pipeline and experience:

<!-- TODO: outline what these are -->

* Clearing:
* Ledger:
* Transaction Monitoring:
* User experience:
* Security:

Previous to this I had worked in other FinTech spaces (e.g. market surveillance, loan origination) but never in a payments space. The only somewhat applicable skill I had was from my time working in market surveillance. During this time I was in the team responsible for writing algorithms to spot suspicious or illegal activities on exchange markets, which only tangentially relates to transaction monitoring. From this almost zero knowledge start, within the space of the year, I was able to become a subject matter expert in this area and able to lead projects, manage key stakeholders, and drive product direction.

In this post, I want to discuss my approach to learning within a new space, and how to build up your knowledge at light-speed to become an invaluable asset.

## Starting

When approaching a new space where you don't have any prior domain knowledge, there will be an almost overwhelming amount of information to take in. The way I approach this is to immediately start grouping information into categories which I use to compartmentalise the knowledge. This breaks things down from an excessively large, amorphous problem space into discrete components which can more easily be comprehended. When doing this, it is never going to be perfect, since correctly dividing up the space requires complete knowledge (similar to what we see in the [data model paradox](../data-model-paradox)).

*NOTES*

How I became "Mr. Payments"

* Quote from anonymous engineer
* always ask questions
* don't stop with a working solution
* put yourself in the customers shoes
* always consider "what knowledge do I have that others don't" when explaining things. This avoids confusing or misleading assumptions.
* go from first principals, build up understand like LEGOs
* teach/help others -> reflective learning
