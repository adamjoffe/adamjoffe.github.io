## Sharing Ideas and Knowledge

Across all aspects of what humans do, it is critical that we share our knowledge and ideas, so that we can build from the work of those who have come before us and continue progressing forward. Software engineering is a new field relative to the expanse of human knowledge collection. As such, it is a rapidly evolving industry where there is a constant stream of knowledge to keep up with. This can be extremely daunting, especially with the expectation of some employers for engineers do learning in their personal time.

There are many different ways to share and learn from each other, but one of the main ones I've always been suggested was books. However, as the title of this may allude to, I don't think they're the best way to learn. So let's be a little controversial and make an argument against books!

## Books: Good and Bad

Before the pitchforks come out, we will start by just doing a simple pros and cons of books for the purpose of learning and keeping up with the software engineering sphere. Firstly, they are an excellent resource given the fact that the form factor allows them to deeply explore and express a topic, aspect, or principal of software engineering. However, by the same metric they are extremely dense, so can be daunting and unapproachable for a lot of people.

The other benefit of books is they have a high barrier to entry for producing a book. Compared to writing a blog (this costs literally $0 to host) or online forums (Stack Overflow, Reddit, etc.) it costs real money to publish and distribute a book. This means there is an argument to be made that more thought goes into the content of a book, so they are higher quality.

However, whilst a book is more likely to be higher quality, the nature of the media also means the content is static, so can't easily be updated if there are errors or even if they become outdated relative to current thinking or trends. This leads to my other key argument against books, they are a one-sided form of media, which restricts the discussion or feedback the consumer can have with the author. It is also much harder to ask questions or get clarifications for what is being presented.

**Notes**
Dogma-ybe: Books are great but...
0\. Intro - technical knowledge sharing and ideas

1. Books good and bad - Excellent resources, dense and unapproachable, used for gatekeeping, one sided, the false dichotomy of the "right" design
2. Teaching Children - school layered learning structure, "books are to engineering what a PhD is to a first year uni student"
3. How else to learn? - conversations, trying and failing, general critical thinking

Small bit-size chunks to work around personal time given expectations from employers

EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT
