## What does the customer want?

Ultimately, customer's have a problem that they need to solve, and to solve the problem they will look to the market to find a product that does this for them. As the creators of a product, we need to ensure that our developed product fits the customer's needs, this is the [product market fit](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/product-market-fit/).

Finding this product market fit almost always involves iteration and innovation, as you're very unlikely to get it right first time out. Therefore, getting the product out there to collect customer feedback and continuously enhancing the product to address their problem is the way forward.

This feedback loop, drives customer engagement and desire for the products, ultimately driving sales providing value to the business and keeps you in the job. So this should also be what you want!

## Building the product pipeline

To gain the true benefit of the customer feedback loop the product pipeline must be constructed to allow enhancements to be made to the product as regular as possible, even multiple times a day!

Now to build this pipeline, a simple recipe can be followed:

1. Mono environment
2. Auto deployment
3. Shift left
4. Metrics
5. Experiment

### Step 1 - Mono Environment



### Step 2 - Auto Deployment

### Step 3 - Shift Left

### Step 4 - Metrics

### Step 5 - Experiment
