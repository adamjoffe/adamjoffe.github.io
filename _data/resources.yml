        summary: >-
          Discussion on limitation of scopes for authorisation as part of the OAuth2 spec.
          Suggests scopes are a subset of permissions for a user, and actual user privileges need to be calculated to make full access control decisions.

        summary: >-
          Explores downsides of using scopes entirely for authorisation and proposes using authorisation component/service within subnet/sidecar of the application to make access decisions.

          Covers extreme tuning of an HTTP server, looking at software, kernel and hardware optimisations through the eyes of a flame graph to achieve 1.2M API req/s on a 4 vCPU EC2 instance.
          Good for understanding the anatomy of an HTTP server and a common multi-threading use-case. 
          It also highlights the need for balance between the diminishing returns of optimisations and other functional benefits.

          Discusses the benefits of testing something in production. In particular, it touches on legacy software and maintenance point of view given payments has been around for a long time.
          Denotes staging environment downsides of never reflecting reality, so illustrates how this quickly hits a limitation and doesn't provide certainty which testing should give.
