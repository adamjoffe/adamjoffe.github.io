*NOTES*:

Cooking Code
0\. Fun analogy because they're 2 things I like. "This is not the same as cooking the books"

1. Code itself is like baking, you need to follow a recipe, and order/process matters. I.e. you need to whip the egg whites first, just like you need to correctly process data structure (?)
2. Architecture and design is like cooking, you need to taste as you go, and there is no "right way" just what is your taste preferences (i.e. business use cases)
